## How Automation Works

### Checking Process

   - Checks all 3 locations for available appointments
   - Compares dates with your current appointment
   - Applies your date range filters
   - Identifies the best (earliest) appointment

### Booking Process

When a qualifying appointment is found:

1. Selects the facility from dropdown
2. Sets the appointment date
3. Fetches available times for that date
4. Selects the first available time slot
5. Submits the appointment form
6. Confirms the booking
7. Redirects to your account page
